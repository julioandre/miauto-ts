# MiAuto Mobile Front-end Repository
Welcome to the MiAuto front-end repository. This is the codebase of the front end, of the MiAuto project.
The usual goal of this project is to build a responsive (smartphones friendly) and bilingual (English & Spanish) web application that allows Meresa’s clients to register cars and follow up their cars’ maintenance or reparations to the detail. 

## Contents of the repository 
As mentioned this repository contains only the front-end part of the project. In other words, the react app. The architecture of the project looks like this:

## Mode of Code Contribution

To keep the repository clean and structured. When contributing to this repo, developers are required to make a branch with the name as the feature they are working on. When they are done they make pull requests to have the code merged, and after a review from another developer only then can the code be merged to the main branch. 

## Deployment 
This web application is hoated and can be found at the link below:
https://miautots.web.app/

## Starting the Project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
